a program which takes the choice of the user after playing a video, then playing another video corresponding to
the choice of the user, activating a tree of choices. (interactive movie)

Show part 1

User has choice between A or B: set A = True, B = False, or A = False, B = True

If A == True, show part 2a, otherwise show part 2b

If watching part 2a, user has choice between C and D: set C = True, D = False, or C = False, D = True

If watching part 2b, user has choice between C and E: set C = True, E = False, or C = False, E = True

If C == True, show part 3c, else if D == True, show part 3d, otherwise show part 3e ..... etc.

Can then later combine e.g. if C == True and F == True..... elif A == True and D == False.....
